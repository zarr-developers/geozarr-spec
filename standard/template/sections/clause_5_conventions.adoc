== Conventions

This section describes the conventions used throughout this Standard, including identifiers, metadata schemas, and referencing mechanisms relevant to the GeoZarr Unified Data Model.

=== Identifiers

The normative provisions in this Standard are denoted by the base URI:

`http://www.opengis.net/spec/geozarr/1.0`

All requirements, recommendations, permissions, and conformance tests that appear in this document are assigned relative URIs anchored to this base.

For example:

`http://www.opengis.net/spec/geozarr/1.0/conf/core` â€” refers to the Core Requirements Class of the GeoZarr Unified Data Model.

=== Data Encoding

This Standard specifies the encoding of geospatial data in the Zarr format. Zarr is a chunked, compressed, binary format for n-dimensional arrays, with support for both Version 2 and Version 3 encodings.

The specification makes extensive use of:

- `zarr.json` metadata documents (Zarr v3)
- `.zgroup`, `.zattrs`, `.zarray` metadata files (Zarr v2)
- JSON-compatible structures for metadata, attributes, and conformance declarations

=== Schemas

Metadata schemas referenced in this Standard are represented using JSON-compatible objects and may be defined formally using JSON Schema. Metadata structures for tile matrix sets, STAC properties, or CF metadata may be embedded inline or referenced externally via URI.

=== URI Usage

URIs used in this Standard must comply with [RFC3986] (URI Syntax). When including reserved characters in a URI, they must be percent-encoded. Dataset identifiers, metadata links, and STAC references should use persistent and canonical forms to support reproducibility and catalogue integration.
