=== Terms and definitions

==== array

A multidimensional, regularly spaced collection of values (e.g., raster data or gridded measurements), typically indexed by dimensions such as time, latitude, longitude, or spectral band.

==== chunk

A sub-array representing a partition of a larger array, used to optimise data access and storage. In Zarr, data is stored and accessed as a collection of independently compressed chunks.

==== coordinate variable

A one-dimensional array whose values define the coordinate system for a dimension of one or more data variables. Typical examples include latitude, longitude, time, or vertical levels.

==== data variable

An array containing the primary geospatial or scientific measurements of interest (e.g., temperature, reflectance). Data variables are defined over one or more dimensions and associated with metadata.

==== dimension

An index axis along which arrays are organised. Dimensions provide a naming and ordering scheme for accessing data in multidimensional arrays (e.g., `time`, `x`, `y`, `band`).

==== group

A container for datasets, variables, dimensions, and metadata in Zarr. Groups may be nested to represent a logical hierarchy (e.g., for resolutions or collections).

==== metadata

Structured information describing the content, context, and semantics of datasets, variables, and attributes. GeoZarr metadata includes CF attributes, geotransform definitions, and links to STAC metadata where applicable.

==== multiscale dataset

A dataset that includes multiple representations of the same data variable at varying spatial resolutions. Each resolution level is associated with a tile matrix from an OGC Tile Matrix Set.

==== tile matrix set

A spatial tiling scheme defined by a hierarchy of zoom levels and consistent grid parameters (e.g., scale, CRS). Tile Matrix Sets enable spatial indexing and tiling of gridded data.

==== transform

An affine transformation used to convert between grid coordinates and geospatial coordinates, typically defined using the GDAL GeoTransform convention.

==== unified data model (UDM)

A conceptual model that defines how to structure geospatial data in Zarr using CDM-based constructs, including support for coordinate referencing, metadata integration, and multiscale representations.
