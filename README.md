# GeoZarr-Spec
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/zarr-developers/geozarr-spec.git/cnl-examples?urlpath=%2Fdoc%2Ftree%2Fexamples%2Fgeozarr.ipynb)

GeoZarr Spec aims to provide a geospatial extension to the Zarr specification. Zarr specifies a protocol and format used for storing Zarr arrays, while the present extension defines **conventions** and recommendations for storing **multidimensional georeferenced grid** of geospatial observations (including rasters). 

# Meetings Information
The GeoZarr SWG meets monthly with an agenda and notes kept [here](https://hackmd.io/@briannapagan/geozarr-spec-swg).

To receive updates about meetings and current efforts, join the Google group by navigating to [https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/geozarr](https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/geozarr) and click "Join this group". 

## Status

This specification early drafts (<=v0.4) were created initially by [Spacebel](https://www.spacebel.com/) for the [European Space Agency](https://esa.int) under the [General Support Technology Programme](http://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/Shaping_the_Future/About_the_General_Support_Technology_Programme_GSTP).

**Update 2023-01-20** - This spec is transitioning to community-based development in anticipation of submission as an OGC standard. It has been moved to the `zarr-developers` GitHub organization. Brianna Pagan ([@briannapagan](https://github.com/briannapagan)) has volunteered to coordinate the community development process.
Feedback from users and implementers will be solicited from the community and incorporated into future drafts.
Information about how to get involved in this process will be announced soon/
