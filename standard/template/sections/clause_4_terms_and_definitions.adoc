=== Terms and definitions

GeoZarr specification inherits https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v3/core/index.html#concepts-and-terminology[concepts and terminology from the Zarr core specification].
The following terms adds Geozarr specificity to the existing Zarr terminology

==== array

A multidimensional, regularly spaced collection of values (e.g., raster data or gridded measurements), typically indexed by dimensions such as time, latitude, longitude, or spectral band.

==== chunk

A sub-array representing a partition of a larger array, used to optimise data access and storage. In Zarr, data is stored and accessed as a collection of independently compressed chunks.

==== coordinate variable

A one-dimensional array whose values define the coordinate system for a dimension of one or more data variables. Typical examples include latitude, longitude, time, or vertical levels.

==== data variable

An array containing the primary geospatial or scientific measurements of interest (e.g., temperature, reflectance). Data variables are defined over one or more dimensions and associated with attributes.

==== dimension

An index axis along which arrays are organised. Dimensions provide a naming and ordering scheme for accessing data in multidimensional arrays (e.g., `time`, `x`, `y`, `band`).

==== dataset

A group that contains one or more data variables along with their associated coordinate variables, having a consistent relationship between these components. A dataset represents a coherent set of related data arrays and follows the unified data model.

==== metadata

Structured information describing the content, context, and semantics of datasets, variables, and attributes. GeoZarr metadata includes CF attributes, geotransform definitions, and links to STAC metadata where applicable.

==== multiscale group

A group that contains 2 or more child groups representing the same data at different resolutions, where each child group is a <<term-dataset,dataset>>. The multiscale group includes metadata describing the relationship between resolution levels.

==== tile matrix set

A spatial tiling scheme defined by a hierarchy of zoom levels and consistent grid parameters (e.g., scale, CRS). Tile Matrix Sets enable spatial indexing and tiling of gridded data.

==== transform

An affine transformation used to convert between grid coordinates and geospatial coordinates, typically defined using the GDAL GeoTransform convention.

==== unified data model (UDM)

A conceptual model that defines how to structure geospatial data in Zarr using CDM-based constructs, including support for coordinate referencing, metadata integration, and multiscale representations.
