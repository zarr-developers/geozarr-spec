== Conformance

Datasets can include many different types of data includes rasters, combinations—such as time, height, or wavelength—and can use either a projected or geographic coordinate system.

This Standard identifies conformance classes rg r offer clear, testable building blocks as a standardised approach for representing different data types when converting to the GeoZarr Unified Data Model (e.g. for encoding RGB bands from a GeoTIFF source).

TIP: This is a very preliminary draft. The content is primarily for demonstrating the purpose of the proposed sections.
