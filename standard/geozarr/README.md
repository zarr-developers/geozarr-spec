Steps for building documentation:
 1. Ensure you have Ruby installed, e.g., through [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme)
 2. Ensure you have a recent version of Asciidoctor installed (e.g. `gem install asciidoctor`)
 3. Run `asciidoctor --safe -a data-uri -D output cf/cf-conventions.adoc`
