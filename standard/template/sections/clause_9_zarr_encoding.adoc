== Encodings for Zarr

This clause defines the normative mapping between the **GeoZarr Data Model** and the **Zarr storage format**.
It specifies how the structural elements of the **Common Data Model (CDM)** - groups, variables, dimensions, and attributes — are encoded in **Zarr v2** and **Zarr v3**, and identifies additional constraints introduced by GeoZarr.

GeoZarr’s encoding rules are limited to cases where explicit guidance is required for interoperability.
GeoZarr does **not** redefine how CF, GDAL, or other metadata conventions map to CDM constructs — these mappings are already implemented in community libraries such as *xarray*, *GDAL*, and *netCDF-Java*.

The GeoZarr encoding rules therefore focus on **CDM structure and semantics**, with additional subsections specifying any **Zarr-specific requirements** for supported metadata conventions.
