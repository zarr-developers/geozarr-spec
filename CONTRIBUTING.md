# Contributing Guide

> This guide is a draft under construction.

## 1. Read the specification

Consult the latest Editor’s Draft before proposing changes:

* HTML: [https://zarr.dev/geozarr-spec/documents/standard/template/geozarr-spec.html](https://zarr.dev/geozarr-spec/documents/standard/template/geozarr-spec.html)
* PDF: [https://zarr.dev/geozarr-spec/documents/standard/template/geozarr-spec.pdf](https://zarr.dev/geozarr-spec/documents/standard/template/geozarr-spec.pdf)

## 2. Understand GeoZarr objectives

GeoZarr does not define a new data model. The work  focuses on concrete and thematic Zarr conventions that address specific community needs. Each convention provides a clear and self-contained extension for a defined topic and supports practical adoption.

## 3. Scope and workflow for changes

* Avoid modifying multiple sections at once.
* Propose initial changes in a focused section.
* Use GitHub issues for discussion before drafting large updates.
* Create a branch in the main repository for visible collaborative work.

## 4. Participation

* All community members may comment on issues and pull requests.
* Monthly OGC GeoZarr SWG meetings provide a forum to review open work.
* Example datasets can be contributed to [https://github.com/developmentseed/geozarr-examples](https://github.com/developmentseed/geozarr-examples).

## 5. Maintenance structure

### Write access

Granted to a [defined maintenance team](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/teams/geozarr). This includes SWG chairs and additional contributors approved by them. Requests to be added to the maintenance team may be community either as a post on the [OGC Agora General Space](https://agora.ogc.org/c/overview-716766/) or at a [OGC GeoZarr Monthly meeting](https://agora.ogc.org/c/events-geozarr-swg/).

### Review and approval

Informal reviews may involve any participant.
For contested matters, only designated OGC GeoZarr SWG voting members may cast formal votes.

### Pull request process

* PRs are reviewed during regular SWG meetings.
* Consensus is required for merge.
* If consensus cannot be reached, an OGC formal vote may be initiated by email.
* PR authors should ensure that discussion items are placed on the next SWG meeting agenda.

## 6. Versioning and releases

The group follows semantic versioning for official releases. Minor editorial or encoding improvements may occur between major releases when consensus allows.

## 7. Roadmap

Work should follow the priorities defined in the roadmap:
