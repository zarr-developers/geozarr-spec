.Preface

The GeoZarr Standard defines a layered, standards-based framework for representing and encoding geospatial and scientific datasets in the Zarr format. The purpose of this document is to provide implementation guidance and normative structure for consistent, interoperable adoption of GeoZarr across tools, platforms, and services. This work extends prior standardisation efforts within the OGC, including OGC API – Tiles, the Tile Matrix Set Standard, and EO metadata conventions, and anticipates integration with catalogue systems such as STAC.

This Standard has been developed in collaboration with contributors from Earth observation, climate science, geospatial analysis, and cloud-native geodata infrastructure communities. Future work may extend this model to additional storage formats, API services, and semantic layers.

== Abstract

Zarr provides efficient chunked storage for n-dimensional arrays but do not provide with the semantic constructs required for geospatial and scientific data workflows.

GeoZarr defines an abstract data model and a set of conventions for representing geospatial and scientific datasets in the Zarr format:

- GeoZarr bridges the Unidata CDM and the Zarr format. GeoZarr establishes the link between the Unidata Common Data Model (CDM) and the Zarr format by defining how the semantic constructs of the CDM are represented within Zarr’s storage model.
- Supports community metadata standards like CF, GeoTIFF, and GDAL.
- Extends CDM for geospatial through multiscale overviews and affine transformations.

By providing a standardized framework for geospatial semantics, GeoZarr enables scientific and geospatial applications to fully utilize cloud-native storage architectures while maintaining the rich metadata and coordinate referencing required for Earth observation workflows. The result is a modern, scalable approach to storing and accessing geospatial data that meets the needs of both data providers and consumers.
