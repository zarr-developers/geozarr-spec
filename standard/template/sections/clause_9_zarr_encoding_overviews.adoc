=== Encoding of Multiscale Overviews in Zarr

This clause specifies how multiscale tiling (also known as overviews or pyramids) is encoded in Zarr stores conforming to the unified data model. The encoding supports both Zarr Version 2 and Version 3 and is aligned with the OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set Standard.

A <<term-multiscale-group,multiscale group>> contains one or more child groups, where each child group is a <<term-dataset,dataset>> representing a zoom level of the data. Additional resolution levels can be added over time, with each new level storing a coarser-resolution resampled version of the original data variables.

==== Hierarchical Layout

Each zoom level SHALL be represented as a child group, identified by the Tile Matrix identifier (e.g., `"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"`). These child groups SHALL be organized hierarchically under a common multiscale group and each SHALL be a <<term-dataset,dataset>> containing the complete set of variables (arrays) corresponding to that resolution. All zoom-level datasets MUST maintain consistent structure.

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Structure |Zarr v2 |Zarr v3

|Zoom level datasets | Subdirectories with `.zgroup` and `.zattrs` | Subdirectories with `zarr.json`, `node_type: group`

|Variables at each level | Arrays (`.zarray`, `.zattrs`) in each dataset | Arrays (`zarr.json`, `node_type: array`) in each dataset

|Multiscale metadata | `multiscales` defined in multiscale group `.zattrs` | `multiscales` defined in multiscale group `zarr.json` under `attributes`
|===

Each zoom-level dataset MUST define chunking (tiling) along the spatial dimensions (`X`, `Y`, or `lon`, `lat`). Recommended chunk sizes are 256×256 or 512×512.

==== Metadata Encoding

Multiscale metadata SHALL be defined using a `multiscales` attribute located in the multiscale group. This attribute SHALL be a JSON object with the following members:

- `tile_matrix_set` – Identifier, URI, or inline JSON object compliant with OGC TileMatrixSet v2
- `resampling_method` – One of the standard string values (e.g., `"nearest"`, `"average"`)
- `tile_matrix_set_limits` – (optional) Zoom-level limits following the STAC Tiled Asset style

===== Zarr v2 Encoding Example (`.zattrs`)
[source,json]
----
{
  "multiscales": {
    "tile_matrix_set": "WebMercatorQuad",
    "resampling_method": "nearest"
  }
}
----

===== Zarr v3 Encoding Example (`zarr.json`)
[source,json]
----
{
  "zarr_format": 3,
  "node_type": "group",
  "attributes": {
    "multiscales": {
      "tile_matrix_set": "WebMercatorQuad",
      "resampling_method": "nearest"
    }
  }
}
----

==== Tile Matrix Set Representation

The `tile_matrix_set` member MAY take one of the following forms:

- A string referring to a well-known identifier (e.g., `"WebMercatorQuad"`)
- A URI pointing to a JSON document describing the tile matrix set
- An inline JSON object (CamelCase, OGC TMS 2.0 compatible)

Zoom level identifiers in the tile matrix set MUST match the names of the child groups. The spatial reference system declared in `supportedCRS` MUST match the one declared in the corresponding `grid_mapping` of the data variables.

==== Chunk Layout Alignment

At each zoom level, chunking SHALL match the tile layout defined by the TileMatrix:

- Chunks MUST be aligned with the tile grid (1:1 mapping between chunks and tiles)
- Chunk sizes MUST match the `tileWidth` and `tileHeight` declared in the TileMatrix
- Spatial dimensions MUST be clearly identified using `dimension_names` (v3) or `_ARRAY_DIMENSIONS` (v2)

==== Tile Matrix Set Limits

The `tile_matrix_set_limits` object MAY define the extent of actual data coverage for each zoom level. This follows the style of the STAC tiled-assets extension rather than the full OGC JSON encoding.

Example:
[source,json]
----
"tile_matrix_set_limits": {
  "1": {
    "min_tile_col": 0,
    "max_tile_col": 1,
    "min_tile_row": 0,
    "max_tile_row": 1
  }
}
----

==== Resampling Method

The `resampling_method` MUST indicate the method used for downsampling across zoom levels. The value MUST be one of:

`nearest`, `average`, `bilinear`, `cubic`, `cubic_spline`, `lanczos`, `mode`, `max`, `min`, `med`, `sum`, `q1`, `q3`, `rms`, `gauss`

The same method MUST apply across all levels.
