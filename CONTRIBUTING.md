## 3. Scope and workflow for changes

* Avoid modifying multiple sections at once.
* Propose initial changes in a focused section.
* Use GitHub issues for discussion before drafting large updates.
* Create a branch in the main repository for visible collaborative work.

## 4. Participation

* All community members may comment on issues and pull requests.
* Monthly OGC GeoZarr SWG meetings provide a forum to review open work.
* Example datasets can be contributed to [https://github.com/developmentseed/geozarr-examples](https://github.com/developmentseed/geozarr-examples).

## 5. Maintenance structure

### Write access

Granted to a defined maintenance team. This includes SWG chairs and additional contributors approved by them.

### Review and approval

Informal reviews may involve any participant.
For contested matters, only designated OGC GeoZarr SWG voting members may cast formal votes.

### Pull request process

* PRs are reviewed during regular SWG meetings.
* Consensus is required for merge.
* If consensus cannot be reached, an OGC formal vote may be initiated by email.
* PR authors should ensure that discussion items are placed on the next SWG meeting agenda.

## 6. Versioning and releases

The group follows semantic versioning for official releases. Minor editorial or encoding improvements may occur between major releases when consensus allows.
