== Overview

The **GeoZarr Standard** defines an **abstract data model** and a set of **conventions** for representing and describing geospatial and scientific datasets using the **Zarr** format.

Zarr provides efficient, chunked storage for n-dimensional arrays but does not include the semantic constructs required for geospatial and scientific data workflows. The **Unidata Common Data Model (CDM)** addresses this gap by introducing essential concepts that structure information through **variables**, **groups**, **coordinates**, and **metadata**. This abstract data model provides the semantic framework that enables structured interpretation of array-based data on top of Zarr’s storage foundation.

The **primary objective** of GeoZarr is to specify how the **CDM** is encoded within Zarr. GeoZarr provides normative rules for encoding these CDM concepts in Zarr and thereby standardises the encoding practices already adopted by CDM-compatible libraries such as **xarray** and **nczarr**, promoting consistent interpretation and interoperability across tools and platforms.

By defining an **abstract model** based on the **CDM** and a corresponding **encoding for Zarr**, GeoZarr establishes an explicit relationship between **the conceptual structure of the data** and **its physical storage representation**. Zarr defines how data are stored and accessed as chunked, hierarchical arrays, while GeoZarr specifies how this stored structure represents the scientific and geospatial meaning of the dataset..

As a **secondary objective**, GeoZarr extends the **CDM base layer** with additional capabilities required for geospatial and cloud-native applications. These extensions include **multiscale overviews**, which enable the representation of data at multiple levels of detail, and **affine transformations**, which define the spatial relationship between data coordinates and real-world locations. All extensions remain fully aligned with the CDM framework.

The **CDM** base layer also provides a **generic framework** capable of hosting metadata from a wide range of community standards. GeoZarr encourages the use of the **Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions**, which are themselves defined around the CDM model, without imposing them as mandatory. This flexibility also supports metadata from other domain-specific standards such as **GeoTIFF**, **GDAL**, and similar geospatial conventions.
