== Unified Data Model

=== Scope and Purpose

This Standard defines a unified data model (UDM) that provides a conceptual framework for representing geospatial and scientific data in Zarr. The purpose of this model is to support standards-based interoperability across Earth observation systems and analytical environments, while preserving compatibility with existing data models and software ecosystems..

The unified data model incorporates and extends the following established specifications and community standards:

- **Unidata Common Data Model (CDM)** – Provides the foundational resource structure for scientific datasets, encompassing dimensions, coordinate systems, variables, and associated metadata elements.
- **CF (Climate and Forecast) Conventions** – Defines a widely adopted metadata profile for describing spatiotemporal semantics in CDM-based datasets.
- **Selected constructs from related Standards and practices**, including:
  - The **OGC Tile Matrix Set Standard**, which enables multi-resolution representations of gridded data.
  - **GDAL geotransform metadata**, used to express affine transformations and interpolation characteristics.
  - **SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)** metadata elements for resource discovery and cataloguing (Collection and Item constructs).

The unified model is format-agnostic and describes the abstract structure of resources independently of the physical encoding. It does not redefine the semantics of the CDM or CF conventions, but introduces integration and extension points required to support tiled multiscale data, geospatial referencing, and metadata for discovery.

This clause specifies the logical composition of the unified model, the external standards it leverages, and the conformance points that facilitate harmonised implementation within the GeoZarr framework.

=== Foundational Model and Standards Reuse

The unified data model described in this Standard is derived from established community specifications to maximise interoperability and to enable the reuse of mature tools and practices. The model is grounded in the Unidata Common Data Model (CDM) and the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions, which together provide a robust framework for representing scientific and geospatial datasets.

==== Common Data Model (CDM)

The CDM defines a generalised schema for representing array-based scientific datasets. The following constructs are reused directly within the unified model:

- **Dimensions** – Integer-valued, named axes that define the extents of data variables.
- **Coordinate Variables** – Variables that supply coordinate values along dimensions, establishing spatial or temporal context.
- **Data Variables** – Multidimensional arrays representing observed or simulated phenomena, associated with dimensions and coordinate variables.
- **Attributes** – Key-value metadata elements used to describe variables and datasets semantically.
- **Groups** – Optional hierarchical containers enabling logical organisation of resources and metadata.

The unified data model adopts these CDM components without modification excluding the user-defined types. Semantic interpretation remains consistent with the original CDM specification. GeoZarr structures are mapped to CDM constructs to ensure compatibility and clarity.

==== CF Conventions

The CF Conventions specify standardised metadata attributes and practices to describe spatiotemporal context within CDM-compliant datasets. These conventions support consistent interpretation of:

- Coordinate systems
- Grid mappings
- Physical units
- Standard variable naming

The unified data model supports CF-compliant metadata, including attributes such as `standard_name`, `units`, and `grid_mapping`. The unified data model does not prescribe CF compliance but enables it through permissive design. Partial adoption of CF attributes is supported, and non-compliant datasets may selectively adopt CF metadata as needed.

==== Standards-Based Extensions

To support additional capabilities, the model defines optional extension points referencing external OGC and community standards:

- **OGC Tile Matrix Set** – Facilitates the definition of multiscale grid hierarchies for raster overviews.
- **GDAL Geotransform** – Enables geospatial referencing through affine transformations and optional interpolation specifications.
- **STAC Metadata (Collection and Item)** – Provides linkage to SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs for resource discovery and indexing.

These extensions are integrated in a modular fashion and do not alter the core semantics of the CDM or CF structures. Implementations may selectively adopt these extensions based on their application requirements.

=== Model Extension Points

The unified data model specifies a series of optional, standards-aligned extension points to support functionality beyond the base CDM and CF constructs. These extensions enhance applicability to Earth observation and spatial analysis use cases without imposing additional mandatory requirements.

Each extension is defined as an independent module. Implementation of any given extension does not necessitate support for others.

==== Multi-Resolution Overviews (OGC Tile Matrix Set)

Support for multi-resolution imagery is enabled via integration with the OGC Tile Matrix Set Standard:

- Tile matrix sets define spatial tiling schemes with consistent resolutions and coordinate reference systems across zoom levels.
- Overviews may be represented as separate Zarr arrays or groups, each aligned to a specific tile matrix level.
- Metadata includes identifiers for tile matrices, spatial resolution, and spatial alignment.

This approach aligns with the OGC API – Tiles and enables efficient access to large gridded datasets.

==== GeoTransform Metadata (GDAL Interpolation and Affine Transform)

Geospatial referencing can be further refined through the inclusion of metadata consistent with GDAL conventions:

- Affine transformation is specified via the `GeoTransform` attribute or equivalent structures.
- Interpolation methods may be declared to indicate sampling behaviour or sub-pixel alignment strategies.

This extension augments CF grid mappings by providing precise control over grid placement and coordinate transformations.

==== STAC Collection and Item Integration

To enable discovery of resources within the hierarchical structure of the data model, this Standard supports the inclusion of STAC metadata elements at appropriate locations within the group hierarchy.

A STAC extension consists of embedding or referencing STAC Collection and Item metadata within the data model:

* Each dataset resource MAY reference a corresponding STAC `Collection` or `Item` using an identifier or embedded object.
* STAC properties such as `datetime`, `bbox`, and `eo:bands` MAY be included in the metadata to enable spatial, temporal, and spectral filtering.
* The structure is compatible with external STAC APIs and metadata harvesting systems.

STAC integration is non-intrusive and modular. It does not impose changes on the internal organisation of datasets and MAY be adopted incrementally by implementations requiring catalogue-based discovery capabilities.


==== Modularity and Interoperability

Each extension point is specified independently. Implementations may advertise support for one or more extensions by declaring conformance to corresponding extension modules. This modularity facilitates incremental adoption, promotes reuse, and enhances interoperability across varied implementation environments.


=== Unified Model Structure

This clause defines the structural organisation of datasets conforming to the unified data model (UDM). It consolidates the foundational elements and optional extensions into a coherent architecture suitable for Zarr encoding, while remaining format-agnostic. The model establishes a modular and extensible framework that supports structured representation of multidimensional, geospatially-referenced resources.

The model represents datasets as abstract compositions of dimensions, coordinate variables, data variables, and associated metadata. This abstraction ensures that applications and services can reason about the content and semantics of a dataset without reliance on storage layout or specific serialisation.

==== Dataset Structure

A dataset conforming to the Unified Data Model (UDM) is structured as a hierarchy rooted at a top-level dataset entity. This design enables modularity and facilitates the representation of complex, multi-resolution, or thematically partitioned data collections.

Each dataset node comprises the following core components, aligned with the Unidata Common Data Model (CDM) and Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions:

- **Dimensions** – Named, integer-valued axes defining the extent of data variables. Examples include `time`, `x`, `y`, and `band`.
- **Coordinate Variables** – Arrays that supply coordinate values along dimensions, providing spatial, temporal, or contextual referencing. These may be scalar or higher-dimensional, depending on the referencing scheme.
- **Data Variables** – Multidimensional arrays representing physical measurements or derived products. Defined over one or more dimensions, these variables are associated with coordinate variables and annotated with metadata.
- **Attributes** – Key-value pairs attached to variables or dataset components. Attributes convey semantic information such as units, standard names, and geospatial metadata.

The hierarchy is implemented through **groups**, which function as containers for variables, dimensions, and metadata. Groups may define local context while inheriting attributes from parent nodes. This supports the logical subdivision of datasets by theme, resolution, or processing stage, and enhances the clarity and reusability of complex geospatial structures.

The diagram below represents the structural layer of the unified data model, derived from the Unidata Common Data Model, which serves as the foundational framework for supporting all overlaying model layer.

Note that, conceptually, node within this hierarchy might be treated as a self-contained dataset.

==== Coordinate Referencing

Coordinate systems are defined using:

- **CF Conventions** – Including attributes such as `standard_name`, `units`, `axis`, and `grid_mapping` to express spatiotemporal semantics and coordinate system properties.
- **Affine Transformation Extensions** – Optional support for georeferencing via affine transforms and interpolation metadata (e.g., as defined in GDAL practices), providing enhanced flexibility for irregular grids and grid-aligned imagery.

The model accommodates both standard CF-compatible definitions and extended referencing mechanisms to support use cases that span scientific analysis and geospatial mapping.

==== Metadata Integration

Metadata may be declared at various levels within the model structure:

- **Global Metadata** – Attributes describing the dataset as a whole, including elements such as `title`, `summary`, and `license`.
- **Variable Metadata** – Attributes associated with individual data or coordinate variables, conveying descriptive or semantic information.
- **Extension Metadata** – Structured metadata linked to optional model extensions (e.g., multiscale tiling, catalogue references, geotransform properties).

All metadata follows harmonised naming and semantics consistent with the CDM and CF standards, enabling machine and human interpretability while supporting metadata exchange across diverse systems.

==== Overviews

The *Overviews* construct defines a formal, interoperable abstraction for multiscale gridded data. It ensures structural consistency across zoom levels and provides a semantic model for integration with tiled representations such as GeoTIFF overviews, OGC API – Tiles, and STAC Tiled Assets.

===== Purpose

The *Overviews* construct provides a general mechanism for associating a single logical data variable with a collection of resampled representations, referred to as *zoom levels*. Each zoom level holds a reduced-resolution version of the original variable, with progressively decreasing spatial resolution from the base (highest detail) to the coarsest level.

Overviews enable:

- Fast access to summary representations for visualisation
- Progressive transmission and downsampling
- Multi-resolution analytics and adaptive processing

===== Conceptual Structure

An *Overviews* construct is defined as a *hierarchical set of multiscale representations* of one or more data variables. It comprises the following components:

[horizontal]
*Base Variable*:: The original, highest-resolution variable to which the overview hierarchy is anchored. It is defined using the standard `DataVariable` structure in the model.
*Overview Levels*:: A sequence of variables representing the same logical quantity as the base variable, but sampled at coarser spatial resolutions.
*Zoom Level Identifier*:: A unique identifier associated with each level, ordered from finest (e.g. `"0"`) to coarsest resolution (e.g. `"N"`).
*Tile Grid Definition*:: A mapping that associates each zoom level with a spatial tiling layout, defined in alignment with a `TileMatrixSet`.
*Spatial Alignment*:: Each overview variable MUST be spatially aligned with the base variable using a consistent coordinate reference system and compatible axis orientation.
*Resampling Method*:: A declared method indicating the technique used to derive coarser levels from the base variable (e.g. `nearest`, `average`, `cubic`).

===== Model Components

The *Overviews* construct is represented in the unified data model using the following logical elements:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Element |Definition

|`OverviewSet` | A logical grouping of variables at multiple zoom levels associated with a single base variable.

|`OverviewLevel` | A single resampled variable at a specific resolution, identified by a zoom level string.

|`TileMatrixSetRef` | A reference to the tile grid specification applied across all overview levels. May refer to a well-known identifier, a URI, or an inline object.

|`TileMatrixLimits` | (Optional) Constraints on the tile coverage per zoom level.

|`resampling_method` | A string indicating the uniform method used to downsample data across all levels.
|===

All overview levels MUST preserve:

- The data variable’s semantic identity (`standard_name`, `units`, etc.)
- The coordinate reference system
- The axis order and dimension semantics

Only the resolution and extent (through tiling and shape) may differ across levels.

===== Relationship to Tile Matrix Set

The *Overviews* construct is structurally aligned with the OGC Tile Matrix Set concept. Each zoom level is mapped to a `TileMatrix`, and the chunk layout for the corresponding data variable SHALL match the tile grid’s `tileWidth` and `tileHeight`.

The `OverviewSet` MAY constrain tile matrix limits using `TileMatrixSetLimits`, which restrict tile indices to actual data coverage, consistent with the spatial extent of the overview variable.

===== Usage Context

The *Overviews* construct is applicable to any gridded data variable with at least two spatial dimensions. It is primarily designed for:

- Raster imagery (e.g. reflectance, temperature)
- Data cubes with spatial slices (e.g. time-series of spatial grids)
- Multi-band products with consistent spatial structure across levels

The structure may be extended for N-dimensional datasets in future revisions, provided that two spatial axes can be unambiguously identified.

=== Conformance and Extensibility

The GeoZarr data model is designed with an open conformance approach to support a wide range of use cases and implementation contexts. Its core model is permissive, allowing partial implementations, while optional extensions and compliance profiles can define stricter requirements for interoperability.

==== Core Conformance

- Datasets conforming to the core model must:
* Represent data using CDM-compatible constructs (dimensions, variables, attributes).
* Follow attribute conventions where applicable.
* Be parsable as valid Zarr with structured metadata following this specification.

- CF compliance is not mandatory but is recommended for semantic interoperability.

==== Extension Conformance

- Implementations may optionally support one or more extension modules:
* Multi-resolution overviews (Tile Matrix Set)
* GeoTransform metadata (GDAL)
* STAC metadata integration

- Each extension defines its own requirement class with validation rules and expected metadata structures.

- Tools may advertise which extensions they support and validate datasets accordingly.

==== Conformance Classes

- Conformance Classes may be defined to specify required components and extensions for specific application domains (e.g., visualisation clients, EO archives, catalogue indexing).
- Conformance Classes enable selective validation without constraining the general model.

==== Extensibility Principles

- All extensions must preserve compatibility with the core model and avoid redefining existing CDM or CF semantics.
- New extensions should be documented with clear identifiers, schemas, and conformance criteria.
- The model encourages interoperability by allowing tools to interpret unknown extensions without failure.

This extensibility framework supports both minimum-viable use and high-fidelity metadata integration, enabling incremental adoption across the geospatial and scientific data communities.

=== Interoperability Considerations

Interoperability is a core objective of the GeoZarr unified data model. The model is designed to bridge diverse Earth observation and scientific data ecosystems by enabling structural and semantic compatibility with established formats and standards, while providing a forward-looking foundation for scalable, cloud-native workflows.

This section outlines the principles and mechanisms supporting interoperability across formats, tools, and communities.

==== Format Mapping and Alignment

The data model is explicitly aligned with foundational standards including the Unidata Common Data Model (CDM), the CF Conventions, and established practices in formats such as NetCDF and GeoTIFF. Where applicable, GeoZarr datasets may be derived from or transformed into these formats using consistent mappings.

- *NetCDF (classic and enhanced models)*:
* GeoZarr shares a common conceptual structure with NetCDF via CDM.
* Variables, dimensions, coordinate systems, and attributes follow directly mappable patterns.
* Metadata expressed in CF conventions in NetCDF can be preserved in GeoZarr without loss of fidelity.

- *GeoTIFF*:
* Raster-based datasets in GeoZarr can map to GeoTIFF by interpreting spatial referencing (via CF or GeoTransform) and band structures.
* Overviews aligned to OGC Tile Matrix Sets may correspond to TIFF image pyramids.
* Projection metadata and resolution information can be mapped via standard tags.

These mappings facilitate round-trip transformations and enable toolchains that consume or produce multiple formats without reengineering semantic models.

==== Semantic Interoperability

Semantic interoperability is supported through adherence to CF conventions, use of standardised attribute names (e.g., `standard_name`, `units`), and alignment with metadata vocabularies used in other ecosystems (e.g., STAC, EPSG codes, ISO 19115 keywords).

The model does not prescribe specific vocabularies beyond CF but encourages reuse and recognition of widely accepted descriptors to promote cross-domain understanding.

==== Metadata and Discovery Integration

STAC compatibility enables integration with catalogue services for discovery and indexing. Datasets can expose STAC-compliant metadata alongside core metadata, supporting federated search and filtering via STAC APIs.

This approach enables seamless integration into modern data catalogues and platforms that support EO discovery standards.

==== Tool and Ecosystem Support

The unified data model facilitates interoperability with tools and libraries across the following domains:

- *Scientific computing*: NetCDF-based libraries (e.g., xarray, netCDF4), Zarr-compatible clients.
- *Geospatial processing*: GDAL, rasterio, QGIS (via Zarr driver extensions or translations).
- *Cloud-native infrastructure*: support for parallel access, chunked storage, and hierarchical grouping compatible with object storage.

Tooling support is expected to grow via standard-conformant implementations, easing adoption across domains and infrastructures.
