== Scope

The GeoZarr Unified Data Model and Encoding Standard defines a conceptual and implementation framework for representing and encoding geospatial and scientific datasets using the Zarr format. The scope of this Standard includes the definition of a format-agnostic unified data model, the specification of its encoding into Zarr Version 2 and Version 3, and the establishment of extension points to support interoperability with external metadata and tiling standards.

These capabilities are necessary because Zarr does not provide semantic constructs for geospatial data interpretation. Applications need to understand not just array shapes and values, but coordinate meanings, projection parameters, and scientific metadata. GeoZarr fills this gap without compromising Zarr's performance characteristics.

=== Why GeoZarr Exists

Zarr, by design, is a low-level container for storing n-dimensional arrays and metadata. While this simplicity is a strength for performance and interoperability, it means Zarr lacks higher-level concepts that geospatial applications require:

* *Coordinate Systems:* No native way to associate spatial or temporal meaning with array dimensions
* *Grid Mappings:* No standard mechanism for projection and coordinate reference system metadata
* *Semantic Metadata:* No conventions for units, standard names, or scientific attributes
* *Variable Relationships:* No formal distinction between coordinate variables and data variables

These concepts are essential for geospatial workflows but must be layered on top of Zarr's array storage. GeoZarr provides this semantic layer through proven standards (Common Data Model and CF conventions) while preserving Zarr's cloud-native advantages.

=== Use Cases and Applications

This Standard addresses the needs of Earth observation, environmental monitoring, and geospatial analysis applications that require efficient, scalable access to multidimensional datasets. It enables the harmonisation of existing data models with operational encoding formats suitable for cloud-native storage and analysis.

Typical use cases include:
* Storage and processing of raster and gridded data
* Management of data cubes with temporal or vertical dimensions
* Integration with catalogue systems through standardized metadata
* Multi-resolution tiling for efficient visualization and analysis
* Cloud-optimized access to large geospatial datasets
