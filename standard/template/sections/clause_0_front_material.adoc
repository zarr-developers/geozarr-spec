.Preface

The GeoZarr Unified Data Model and Encoding Standard defines a layered, standards-based framework for representing and encoding geospatial and scientific datasets in the Zarr format. It integrates foundational specifications such as the Unidata Common Data Model (CDM), the CF Conventions, and selected OGC and community standards to enable semantic, structural, and operational interoperability across Earth observation platforms and geospatial ecosystems.

This Standard introduces a unified model that harmonises metadata structures, array-based data representations, coordinate referencing, and multiscale tiling semantics. It provides a coherent framework that facilitates encoding into Zarr v2 and v3, supporting scalable, cloud-native workflows.

The purpose of this document is to provide implementation guidance and normative structure for consistent, interoperable adoption of GeoZarr across tools, platforms, and services. This work extends prior standardisation efforts within the OGC, including OGC API – Tiles, the Tile Matrix Set Standard, and EO metadata conventions, and anticipates integration with catalogue systems such as STAC.

This Standard has been developed in collaboration with contributors from Earth observation, climate science, geospatial analysis, and cloud-native geodata infrastructure communities. Future work may extend this model to additional storage formats, API services, and semantic layers.

== Abstract

The GeoZarr Unified Data Model and Encoding Standard specifies a conceptual and implementation framework for representing multidimensional, geospatial datasets using the Zarr format. This Standard builds upon the Unidata Common Data Model (CDM) and the Climate and Forecast (CF) Conventions, and introduces interoperable constructs for tiling, georeferencing, and metadata integration.

The model defines core elements—dimensions, coordinate variables, data variables, attributes—and optional extensions for multi-resolution overviews, affine geotransforms, and STAC metadata. Encoding guidance is provided for Zarr Version 2 and Zarr Version 3, including chunking, group hierarchy, and metadata conventions.

GeoZarr aims to bridge scientific and geospatial communities by enabling round-trip transformations with formats such as NetCDF and GeoTIFF, and supporting compatibility with tools in the scientific Python and geospatial ecosystems. This Standard enables scalable, standards-compliant, and semantically rich data structures for cloud-native Earth observation applications.
