=== Encoding of Multiscale Overviews in Zarr

This clause specifies how multiscale tiling (also known as overviews or pyramids) is encoded in Zarr-based datasets conforming to the unified data model. The encoding supports both Zarr Version 2 and Version 3 and is aligned with the OGC Two Dimensional Tile Matrix Set Standard.

Multiscale datasets are composed of a set of Zarr groups representing multiple zoom levels. Each level stores coarser-resolution resampled versions of the original data variables.

==== Hierarchical Layout

Each zoom level SHALL be represented as a Zarr group, identified by the Tile Matrix identifier (e.g., `"0"`, `"1"`, `"2"`). These groups SHALL be organised hierarchically under a common multiscale root group. Each zoom-level group SHALL contain the complete set of variables (Zarr arrays) corresponding to that resolution.

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Structure |Zarr v2 |Zarr v3

|Zoom level groups | Subdirectories with `.zgroup` and `.zattrs` | Subdirectories with `zarr.json`, `node_type: group`

|Variables at each level | Zarr arrays (`.zarray`, `.zattrs`) in each group | Zarr arrays (`zarr.json`, `node_type: array`) in each group

|Global metadata | `multiscales` defined in parent `.zattrs` | `multiscales` defined in parent group `zarr.json` under `attributes`
|===

Each multiscale group MUST define chunking (tiling) along the spatial dimensions (`X`, `Y`, or `lon`, `lat`). Recommended chunk sizes are 256×256 or 512×512.

==== Metadata Encoding

Multiscale metadata SHALL be defined using a `multiscales` attribute located in the parent group of the zoom levels. This attribute SHALL be a JSON object with the following members:

- `tile_matrix_set` – Identifier, URI, or inline JSON object compliant with OGC TileMatrixSet v2
- `resampling_method` – One of the standard string values (e.g., `"nearest"`, `"average"`)
- `tile_matrix_set_limits` – (optional) Zoom-level limits following the STAC Tiled Asset style

===== Zarr v2 Encoding Example (`.zattrs`)
[source,json]
----
{
  "multiscales": {
    "tile_matrix_set": "WebMercatorQuad",
    "resampling_method": "nearest"
  }
}
----

===== Zarr v3 Encoding Example (`zarr.json`)
[source,json]
----
{
  "zarr_format": 3,
  "node_type": "group",
  "attributes": {
    "multiscales": {
      "tile_matrix_set": "WebMercatorQuad",
      "resampling_method": "nearest"
    }
  }
}
----

==== Tile Matrix Set Representation

The `tile_matrix_set` member MAY take one of the following forms:

- A string referring to a well-known identifier (e.g., `"WebMercatorQuad"`)
- A URI pointing to a JSON document describing the tile matrix set
- An inline JSON object (CamelCase, OGC TMS 2.0 compatible)

Zoom level identifiers in the tile matrix set MUST match the names of the child groups. The spatial reference system declared in `supportedCRS` MUST match the one declared in the corresponding `grid_mapping` of the data variables.

==== Chunk Layout Alignment

At each zoom level, chunking SHALL match the tile layout defined by the TileMatrix:

- Chunks MUST be aligned with the tile grid (1:1 mapping between chunks and tiles)
- Chunk sizes MUST match the `tileWidth` and `tileHeight` declared in the TileMatrix
- Spatial dimensions MUST be clearly identified using `dimension_names` (v3) or `_ARRAY_DIMENSIONS` (v2)

==== Tile Matrix Set Limits

The `tile_matrix_set_limits` object MAY define the extent of actual data coverage for each zoom level. This follows the style of the STAC tiled-assets extension rather than the full OGC JSON encoding.

Example:
[source,json]
----
"tile_matrix_set_limits": {
  "1": {
    "min_tile_col": 0,
    "max_tile_col": 1,
    "min_tile_row": 0,
    "max_tile_row": 1
  }
}
----

==== Resampling Method

The `resampling_method` MUST indicate the method used for downsampling across zoom levels. The value MUST be one of:

`nearest`, `average`, `bilinear`, `cubic`, `cubic_spline`, `lanczos`, `mode`, `max`, `min`, `med`, `sum`, `q1`, `q3`, `rms`, `gauss`

The same method MUST apply across all levels.
